## How it works

The "Ripple Carry Adder 8 bit" project adds two 8-bit numbers together using a ripple carry adder (RCA) architecture. This is implemented using a series of full adders, each of which adds two bits along with a carry-in from the previous less significant bit. The result is an 8-bit sum and a carry-out bit for the most significant bit.

The project consists of the following modules:
1. `halfadder`: A simple module that computes the sum and carry-out of two 1-bit inputs.
2. `fulladder`: A module that uses two `halfadder` instances to add three 1-bit inputs (two bits and a carry-in) and produces a sum and carry-out.
3. `rca8`: An 8-bit ripple carry adder module that cascades eight `fulladder` instances to add two 8-bit numbers.
4. `tt_um_example`: The top module that connects the inputs and outputs to the `rca8` module, performing the addition operation and providing the result through the output pins.

The `tt_um_example` module takes two 8-bit inputs (`ui_in` and `uio_in`), adds them using the `rca8` module, and outputs the 8-bit sum (`uo_out`).

## How to test

To test the "Ripple Carry Adder 8 bit" project:

1. Provide two 8-bit numbers as inputs via the `ui_in` and `uio_in` pins.
2. Observe the 8-bit sum output on the `uo_out` pins.
3. Ensure that all connections are made correctly as per the pinout configuration.

For example, if you input the binary numbers `00001101` (13 in decimal) and `00000111` (7 in decimal) on `ui_in` and `uio_in` respectively, the output on `uo_out` should be `00010010` (20 in decimal).

## External hardware

No external hardware is required for this project. It operates purely based on the digital inputs provided and generates a digital output. However, for testing and demonstration purposes, you may use input switches and output LEDs or a similar setup to visualize the input and output binary numbers.
